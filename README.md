# CSC1-2100-FALL2025
Hi, my name is Ashlee Bowser! I am from Dallas, Texas. I am a sophomore this year and majoring in Computer Science. I am interested in this course because data structures are an important building block for the rest of my computer science career, and I've never learned C++ so I am looking forward to learning about it.
